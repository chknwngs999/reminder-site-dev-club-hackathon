DO NOT USE REAL PASSWORDS THEY ARE SAVED IN A DICTIONARY AND ARE NOT HASHED OR HIDDEN BECUASE I DIDN'T DO THAT YET.

ALSO I DON'T USE FLASK SESSIONS SO THE USER IS SAVED IN A VARIABLE, MEANING ONLY ONE USER CAN BE ACTIVE, AND IT WILL BE ACTIVE FOR ALL THAT OPEN IT.

ALSO I PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

The requirements are flask, render_template, and request idk how to add that to requirements.txt
